              administration signed our national bank charter No. 24 in 1863,
              weâ€™ve drawn on our financial strength to serve customers. This has
              been especially evident in times of need, such as during the
              COVID-19 pandemic. Our response by the end of 2020 included a $20
              million premium pay program for our employees, relief assistance
              and 108,000 Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection
              Program (PPP) loans for our customers, and $30 million in
              expedited charitable contributions for our communities.

              At First Monie, we believe that the New World of Fast, Smart,
